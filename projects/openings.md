### What you can gain? üëç

- Basic: A free and fulfilling research environment, comprehensive research/independent work training, ample computing resources, rich industry-academia connections and job opportunities, multidimensional training from partners, more flexibility in the new school. It is okay to affiliate with CS. And there are other benefits.

- **Personalized** training: If you are more senior, I can help you develop your mentorship/leadership skills and become independent. If you are more junior, I can provide more one-on-one hands-on help to develop your skills and pave the way for more future options. Regardless of your stage, I hope we can grow and be happy together! Technology always evolves, and I hope we can create more timeless value together!
What do you need?

### What you need? ü•≥
- **Passion**: Passion is always our top priority for innovation, whether creating code, algorithms, or beautiful content, telling your own story, or making the tools you want to use. 
- Academic Background: Relevant majors such as electronic computing, artificial intelligence, visual computing, and media technology. Research usually involves content not yet included in textbooks, and cutting-edge research can provide more future opportunities. As long as you have a solid foundation and are smart enough, I believe there will be no problem.
- Research Interests: A strong interest in intelligent vision, user-centered, content generation/design/creation tools, etc. Passion for creation and a desire to make beautiful content.

- PS: My MBTI is ENFP, the Happy Puppy. Although our Ph.D. research life often requires us to write code alone, respect objective facts, be rational, and plan (ISTJ), I believe **every new feeling precious**, and genuine passion can help us produce impactful work! Besides solid scientific research, I hope we can also visit art exhibitions and shows, combining art and technology to create something cool! I look forward to having you, passionate about research and innovation, join my team and push forward the development of intelligent vision and creative technology together!
